# Dice Roller
A simple android dice roller to help with d&amp;d games.

To use simply enter a number then select a die to roll that many dice, results are displayed as individual die rolls.
Limited to a max of 1000 dice rolls for performance and because I can't think of a reason why someone would need to roll so many.

## Todo List
### Wants
- usable landscape layout
- dice modifiers
- adv/dis-adv rolls

### Nice to haves
- improve text display
- sum x dice?
- add dice roll animation (can be toggled?)
